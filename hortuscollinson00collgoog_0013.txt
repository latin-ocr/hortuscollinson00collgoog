ΤΗΑΤ Mr. Collinsou, in early lile, began to keep an Alphabetical Register of

the planta he cultivated, appears from tbe heading to the letter Α, which
· originally constituted the first page of his catalogue, “1722, in Horto
Collinsoniauo,” but the third of thesefigures has been subsequently altered
to a 3, and again, afterwards, to a 5. lt is also obvious, from the color of the
ink with which the last alteration was made, that the following words were at
the same time added, and the original title then became, as it now remeius,
“Anno 1752, in Horto Collinsoniano, at Ridgway House, on Mill Hill, in
Hendon, Middlesex.’'

An accident, however, occasioned the addition of another title, and it is
thus recorded :-“The careless boohbinder has misplaced the Alphabetical
Catalogue of my gardan to· my great vexation. l fiad no remedy but patience
to bear it.” By this carelessness the alphabetico! order of the Genera has
been deranged, and a new heading hasbeen crowded in, at the top of the
letter I, which now constitutas the first page. “A Catalogne of the rarer
plauts in Peter Collinson’s gardan, at Mill Hill, in Hendon, Middlcsex, tenn
miles from St. Gile's Pound, in Holbourn. See the milestoues (the first sett
up near London for measuring the roads)‚ my house within a bow shot of
the x milestone.” ¹

Among a large number of detached memoranda which, equally with the
Catalogue, are entirely in Mt. Collinson's handwriting, there isone which
rendere it probable that the last change in the date was made on the com. ¹
pletion of his removal aad new arrangement ol the gardan at Mill Hill.
“April 8, 1749, removed from my house at Pechham in Snrry; for two years
was transplanting my gardan to my house at Mill Hill, called Ridgway llonse,”
and the removal of forty large Evergreens without any injury, is particularly
mentioued.

The gardens at Peckham and Mill Hill had attained such ahigh celebrity,
that a publication of Mr. Collinson's Catalogue appears to have been called for
by some of the most distinguished Naturalists, and the reason for his non·
conrpliance with their wishes is thusgiveu in aletterof bis, dated May 12, 1756,

great business, with many affairs in my head and on my hands. lcan never
